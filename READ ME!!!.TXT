UPDATED: Version 1.10
I've choosen to use TreeView instead Listbox to show
forms and objects/controls.
I think it's too much organized then listboxes, the
application looks more "professional".

You can use this code in your own applications
but don't forget to give me some credit, ok?

Vote for me if you like it!

Thanks
